# Jq4J

**Jq4J** is [`jq`](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) running as pure Java bytecode.

## Why?

`jq` is a very handy tool we all use everyday, sadly it's syntax doesn't follow a spec that can be easily ported across languages.
By compiling `jq` to Wasm and Wasm to Java bytecode thanks to [Chicory](https://chicory.dev) we don't need to port the original source code and we have 1:1 functionality out-of-the-box.

## Quick Start

Add Jq4J as a standard Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.roastedroot</groupId>
    <artifactId>jq4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The usage matches 1:1 the usage through the `jq` CLI, hence you should:
 - define the command line arguments to be used
 - pass the input over on stdin
 - extract the output as stdout

In case of any error you can always inspect stdout/stderr produced by `jq` to identify the issue.
Example:

```java
import io.roastedroot.jq4j.Jq;

var result = Jq.builder()
    .withStdin("{\"foo\": 0}".getBytes(UTF_8))
    .withArgs("-M", "--compact-output", ".")
    .run();

if (result.success()) {
    var resultStr = new String(result.stdout(), UTF_8); // {"foo":0}\n
    ...
} else {
    System.out.println(result.stdout());
    System.err.println(result.stderr());
}
```

## Building the Project

mvn clean install
```

## Acknowledgements

This project stands on the shoulders of giants:

* [go-jq](https://github.com/wasilibs/go-jq) - go-jq is a distribution of jq, that can be built with Go
* [Chicory](https://chicory.dev/) â€“ a native JVM WebAssembly runtime
